=== Links To Tweets

Adds clickable links to quoted tweets.

If you block 3rd party content, tweets will not be displayed on page.  Quite
possibly, you won't even notice that something was intended to be shown.
Thanks to this script, a regular link will appear, so you can click it,
and read the tweet on Twitter.
