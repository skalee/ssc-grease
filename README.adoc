= SSC Grease

Greasemonkey (and friends) scripts for SkyScraperCity.com users.

Tested with Greasemonkey on Firefox.  May require minor changes to work on
Chrome.  May work in IE as well.

== Scripts

=== Big "go to new post" button (improved)

Makes "Go to new post" button on User CP, and Subscriptions pages way bigger,
hence easier to click on.

=== Links To Tweets

Adds clickable links to quoted tweets.

If you block 3rd party content, tweets will not be displayed on page.  Quite
possibly, you won't even notice that something was intended to be shown.
Thanks to this script, a regular link will appear, so you can click it,
and read the tweet on Twitter.

=== Stubborn

Detects "Database Error" pages,Â and perserveringly reloads them until it
succeeds.
