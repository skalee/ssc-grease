= SSC Grease

Greasemonkey (and friends) scripts for SkyScraperCity.com users.

Tested with Greasemonkey on Firefox.  May require minor changes to work on
Chrome.  May work in IE as well.

== Scripts

=== Big "go to new post" button (improved)

Makes "Go to new post" button on User CP, and Subscriptions pages way bigger,
hence easier to click on.
